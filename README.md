# Technical requirements

- The project involves the creation of a counter using JavaScript that allows you to increase and decrease numbers with keys +/-.
- The use of Jquery is not allowed, the use of any framework (React, Angular, Vue...) is not allowed.
- The use of external JavaScript libraries is permitted, if necessary.
- The +/- buttons, and also the display of the counter value must be implemented with JavaScript.

# Idea 

I chose to make a sushi-themed counter that involves increasing numbers as if you were counting the pieces of sushi you can eat. Being passionate about oriental cuisine, I thought it was fun.
